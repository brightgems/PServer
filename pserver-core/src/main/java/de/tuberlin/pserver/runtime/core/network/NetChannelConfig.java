    // TCP Tuning - http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/11/17/tcp_tuning.html

    // HOW TCP WORKS

    // The most common network protocol used on the internet is the Transmission Control
    // Protocol, or TCP. TCP uses a "congestion window" to determine how many packets it
    // can send at one time. The larger the congestion window size, the higher the throughput.
    // The TCP "slow start" and "congestion avoidance" algorithms determine the size of the
    // congestion window. The maximum congestion window is related to the amount of buffer
    // space that the kernel allocates for each socket. For each socket there is a default
    // value for the buffer size, which programs can change by using a system library call
    // just before opening the socket. For some operating systems there is also a kernel-enforced
    // maximum buffer size. You can adjust the buffer size for both the sending and receiving
    // ends of the socket.

    // To achieve maximum throughput, it is critical to use optimal TCP socket buffer sizes
    // for the link you are using. If the buffers are too small, the TCP congestion window
    // will never open up fully, so the sender will be throttled. If the buffers are too large,
    // the sender can overrun the receiver, which will cause the receiver to drop packets and
    // the TCP congestion window to shut down. This is more likely to happen if the sending host
    // is faster than the receiving host. An overly large window on the sending side is not a big
    // problem as long as you have excess memory.

    // COMPUTING TCP BUFFER SIZE

    // Assuming there is no network congestion or packet loss, network throughput is directly
    // related to TCP buffer size and the network latency. Network latency is the amount of time
    // for a packet to traverse the network. To calculate maximum throughput:
    // (1) Throughput = buffer size / latency

    // Most networking experts agree that the optimal TCP buffer size for a given network link is
    // double the value for delay times bandwidth:
    // (2) buffer size = 2 * delay * bandwidth

    // The ping program will give you the round trip time (RTT) for the network link, which is twice
    // the delay, so the formula simplifies to:
    // (3) buffer size = RTT * bandwidth

    // NOTE: Linux assumes that half of the send/receive buffer is used for internal
    // kernel structures; thus the sysctls are twice what can be observed on the wire.
